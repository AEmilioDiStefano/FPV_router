# INSTRUCTIONS

# 1. Prepare your SD Card for the Raspberry Pi

### NOTE: Use the official Raspberry Pi Imager!

## 1.1 Insert your SD card in to your laptop via USB adapter or full-sized SD adapter

## 1.2 Open the Raspberry Pi Imager and enter the following specifications:

**Raspberry Pi 4** as your **Raspberry Pi Device** (unless you are using a Raspberry Pi 5)

**Ubuntu Server 24.04.3 LTS (64-BIT)** as your **Operating System** (this will be under "General Purpose OS" and then "Ubuntu")

**The SD card you would like to flash** as your **Storage**

## 1.3 Set your initial specifications for the Pi

After you have set the **Raspberry Pi Device**, **Operating System**, and **Storage**, click **NEXT** and you will see a pop-up window asking if you would like to apply OS customization settings.  Click **EDIT SETTINGS**
